## lab onboarding - badge access, etc

If you are a brand new member of the lab, please add yourself to the lab census
by filling out this [google form](https://forms.gle/FxfgNXQyLtege3x69)! A
working lab census can be found in the appendix, including contact info and
research interests of all current members.

If you haven’t been added to the group slack workspace, ping Jake and he will
add you. Slack is the primary medium by which the group communicates outside of
meetings. In the slack you will find channels for just about any research focus
within the group in addition to channels for socializing and posting pics of
food.

Important background papers for the work in the Theory Division can be found in
the appendix (work in progress).

## lab meeting - schedule and format
Lab meetings are currently scheduled for every Tuesday from 2:30 pm - 4:30 pm.
There are currently four rotating groups of presenters- A, B, C, and D. If you
are new to the theory division, talk to Jake to figure out which group you
should be added to.

Currently, lab meetings are done over zoom (see the lab calendar or slack for
the link) and slides are presented via google slides. You can find the weekly
slide deck, along with the presentation archive, in this google drive. The G1
MD/PhD student in the lab is currently responsible for scheduling lab meetings.
For the 2020-2021 academic year, that’s Davis Weaver.

The format of the presentation is flexible and largely up to individual style,
although there should be an emphasis on efficiency to ensure that everyone has
time to present and receive feedback. There are a few common elements that each
member should have in their presentations:

- “Elevator pitch” slide
  - Should be a graphical illustration of all of your current projects - grows
  as your research progresses.
- Background slide
  - A more formal introduction to your presentation that provides sufficient
  background for a newcomer to the lab. This should be specific to the
  project(s) you are presenting that day (i.e., each project will have its own
  background slide).
- Ending with a “next steps” slide with a concrete action plan can also be
helpful for feedback.

Each of these background slides should have an accompanying paragraph that gives
a basic background for the project (not included in your presentation), complete
with hyperlinks to useful stuff.  This will eventually go on the website/wiki
somewhere - this will allow folks to fill themselves in a bit more, and should
provide breadcrumbs for further reading either of your own stuff, or of other 
background work in the form of out-links.

## case cluster computing

To get access to the Case High Performance Computing Cluster, email
hpc-support@case.edu and cc Jake.

Link to the cluster: https://ondemand.case.edu/pun/sys/dashboard
*Note: you must be on Case Wireless or using a VPN to access.

## lab file server

To access the lab file server, you will need to download a file transfer
protocol (FTP) such as FileZilla or Cyberduck. Then, you can message someone
(i.e. Eshan) in the lab to get the server name, username, and password. You can
then access the server from anywhere, without a VPN.

## espresso machine
